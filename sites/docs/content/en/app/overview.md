# User App: Overview
## Introduction
The **InStep User App** is your personal digital guide for indoor spaces. Designed for both Android and iOS, the app removes the confusion of navigating large buildings. Whether you are looking for a specific classroom, a hospital ward, or the nearest restroom, the app provides a clear, interactive map and real-time directions right on your smartphone.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Map:** View detailed floor plans of the building. You can zoom, rotate, and move the map to explore your surroundings.
- **Smart Search:** Quickly find rooms by their name, number, or category (e.g., "Cafeteria" or "Exit").
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Once you select a destination, the app draws a highlighted path and provides "turn-by-turn" instructions (e.g., "Turn left at the next corner").
- **Real-Time Positioning:** Thanks to built-in sensors and Bluetooth beacons, the app shows exactly where you are standing in the building—no GPS required.
- **Floor Transitions:** If your destination is on a different level, the app will guide you to the nearest stairs or elevator and automatically switch the map view once you arrive at the new floor.
- **Personalized Routing:** Switch to "Barrier-Free Mode" to generate routes that exclusively use elevators and ramps, avoiding stairs entirely.
- **Live Room Status:** Check if a meeting room or office is currently "free" or "occupied" before you head there.

## How to use it
Using InStep is simple: Open the app, search for your destination, and follow the blue line on your screen.  
In case of an emergency, a single tap on the "Emergency" button will immediately show you the fastest and safest way out of the building.
