# Project Overview: InStep

## Introduction
**InStep** is an innovative indoor navigation system designed to help people find their way through complex buildings such as schools, hospitals, airports, and shopping centers.
InStep provides a user-friendly way to navigate between rooms and floors, reducing stress and saving time for visitors, students, and employees alike.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple A-to-B route calculation within buildings.
- **Multi-Floor Support:** Intelligent routing across different floors using stairs or elevators.
- **Barrier-Free Options:** Specialized routing for users with limited mobility (avoiding stairs).
- **Emergency Navigation:** Quickest route to the nearest emergency exit in case of danger.
- **Live Positioning:** Real-time location tracking inside the building using smartphone sensors and small radio beacons.
- **Point of Interest (POI) Finder:** Easily locate restrooms, elevators, fire extinguishers, or charging stations.
- **Digital Map Management:** Easy digitalization of paper-based floor plans into interactive maps.
